# Amino acid sequence

A multiple sequence alignment \(MSA\), as illustrated in Figure , is a sequence alignment of three or more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. Multiple sequence alignments can be useful in many circumstances, e.g., detecting historical and familial relations between sequences of proteins or amino acids and determining certain structures or locations on sequences.

As shown, the lines in dark red stand for the conservation of the amino acids at that position, while the bold lines in orange indicate that the amino acids at position i and j are conserved and coupled.](../.gitbook/assets/leriww_estimated_residue_coupling.png)
