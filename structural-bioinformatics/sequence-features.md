# Sequence features

Given a target protein sequence, _leri_ extracts three types of sequence-based features involving position-specific scoring matrices \(PSSM\), secondary structure \(SS\), and solvent accessibility \(SA\). The PSSM is generated by PSIBLAST \cite{altschul1997gapped} search of the query against a non-redundant sequence database with 20 log-odds scores taken at each position. The secondary structure \(SS\) is predicted by PSI-PRED \cite{jones1999protein}, with the three states defined as alpha-helix, beta-strand, and coil. The solvent accessibility \(SA\) is predicted by the neural networks \cite{chen2005prediction}.
