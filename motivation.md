### At protein level

As protein sequences are naturally encoded evolutionary information that specify their structures and functions, computational analyses have to rapidly decipher it for protein folding & design and drug discovery. Accordingly, an open, online platform that implements bioinformatic analyses and computations to capture significant evolutionary information is needed and required in the highest capacity to make the inferences be actionable in protein engineering.

The aim of this software is to provide computational tools and pipelines for protein folding and design from its amino acid sequence using statistically inferred information. It is written in C++ and support parallel computing. The web-server is open to academia and actively maintained at [Leri Analytics](https://kornmann.bioch.ox.ac.uk/leri/index.html). Leri requires license for commercial use.

Given a protein sequence, how do we understand its folding pathways, make quantitative analysis of mutants of the protein, and then design a \`\`super protein" stabilizing in a large range of temperature?
