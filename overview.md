# Overview

### What is Leri?

**Leri** \(**L**earning **E**ngine to **R**ecognize l**I**fe\) analytics \(termed [**leri**](https://godzilla.uchicago.edu/pages/ngaam/leri/index.html) or [**leria**](https://godzilla.uchicago.edu/pages/ngaam/leri/index.html)\) provides versatile, time- and labor-efficient modules to functionally explore the protein sequences, structures, and genomics sequencing data using statistical analysis coupled to high-throughput sequencing.

Leri is an end-to-end platform initially developed for protein design that drastically improves software used in computational biology. It

* reveals positive and negative genetic interactions in single and multiple mutants
* can identify drug targets
* detects not only essential genes, but also essential protein couplings
* generates other informative couplings
