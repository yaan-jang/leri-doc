# Overview

**Leri** \(**L**earning **E**ngine to **R**ecognize l**I**fe\) analytics \(termed **leri** or **leria**\) provides versatile, time- and labor-efficient modules to functionally explore the protein sequences, structures, and genomics sequencing data using statistical analysis coupled to high-throughput sequencing.

Leri \(1\) reveals positive and negative genetic interactions in single and multiple mutants, \(2\) can identify drug targets, \(3\) detects not only essential genes, but also essential protein couplings, and \(4\) generates other informative couplings.

Leri is an end-to-end platform initially developed for protein design that drastically improves software used in computational biology.
