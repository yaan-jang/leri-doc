# Motivation

The aim of this package is to provide software tools for protein folding and design from its amino acid sequence using statistically inferred information. It is written in C++ and support parallel computing. The code is open source and actively maintained on [Github](https://github.com/yaan-jang/leri), licensed under MIT and LGPL.

Given a protein sequence, how do we understand its folding pathways, make quantitative analysis of mutants of the protein, and then design a \`\`super protein" stabilizing in a large range of temperature?
